# Netflix Recommendation System
This project is an data analysis project for Netflix Dataset. 
It starts with an Exploratory Data Analysis of the used dataset which gives us various insights in the data. 
Next we start using collaborative filtering and filter movies on the basis of their title we realise that it isn't a very accurate approach. 
Then we apply the filtering on the basis of various factors like title, genre, description, director etc. This approach helps us reach a more accurate recommendation.
